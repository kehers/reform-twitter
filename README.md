Chrome extension to fix some design changes on Twitter web.

For now, it only removes the distracting View count. It is still available when you open the tweet itself but not on timelines. 

Feel free to fork and make your own modifications.

## Use

- Download
- Visit `chrome://extensions` on your Chrome browser
- Enable "Developer mode"
- Click "Load Unpacked" and select the downloaded folder
- That's it

If I get to it, I may try and publish on the Chrome store.
